A - Assuming rating is a good estimate of skill
B - Set parameter for home advantage rating boost
C - Set function for mean goals using rating difference as input
D - Set model for draw bias with one parameter

x1 - find games with home advantage
2 - get distribution of rating differences (including home advatage)
3 - get result distribution as a function of reating difference (including home advantage)
4 - simulate results with games with equal distribution of rating differences
5 - adjust home advantage, mean goals, and repeat 4 and 5 to minimze differences
6 - add draw bias
7 - adjust home advantage, mean goals, draw bias, and repeat 4 and 5 to minimze differences
8 - get more games, simulate, and compare
